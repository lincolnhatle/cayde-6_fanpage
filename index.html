        <h3>Light Bearer</h3>
        <p> 
            In his early days as a guardian, Cayde made a name for himself as a daring and adventurer full of wanderlust. His life pre-Vanguard
            had its fair share of reckless abandon and travel outside the tower. This is proven by the myriad of caches he hid throughout the system
            While searching for a hive shrine on the moon, Cayde encountered a massive swarm of hive. Making a swift retreat to the surface, 
            he faced down the endless waves of Thrall and Knights until his machine gun ran empty. While taking cover, he spotted a Baroness from the House of Exile
            fighting the Hive as well. The Hunter and the Fallen made an unlikely alliance and battled the horde side-by-side. As the enemies numbers dwindled,
            so did the last of Caydes ammo. He noticed the Baroness was badly wounded. She threw him her Shock Pistol and attacked him, forcing him to finish her off. 
            Using her weapon, Cayde slayed the Wizard and remaining Thrall. He often wondered after that if the Baroness had attacked him to make his decision to kill her easier.
        </p>
        <h3>Previous Life</h3>
        <p>
            Like many guardians, Cayde is haunted by shadow of his previous life. When he was brought back by his Ghost, Sundance, all he had with him was
            a journal containing Ace's name. The memories, or lack of, his son 'Ace', and Ace's mother, the 'Queen of Hearts', drove Cayde
            to search for answers in the Vault of Glass. A timeless realm the Vex used in the endless simulations. While he never recovered all the memories
            of his past life, he kept writing Ace and his Queen his journal, preserving their memory beyond his eventual resets.
            <br>
            <br>
            Before he became an Exo, Cayde was a human soldier. He was approached by Clovis Bray to join the Exo program and remove his
            debt by joining the Exo program. After becoming in Exo, he lived in a colony on Europa working for Bray Exoscience. At one ponit he was assigned
            as security for a woman named Dr. Maya Sunderesh. It is speculated that the Queen of Hearts he refers to in his journal is actually Dr. Sunderesh,
            and not Aces mother. He beheld The Collapse, as he retained memories through his resets of a destroyed world. Possibly the memory of his death.
        </p>
        <h3>The Dare</h3>
        <p>
            The story of Cayde-6 and the Hunter Vanguard position is a compelling piece of Destiny 2 lore, blending camaraderie, rivalry, and tragic loss. The Hunter Vanguard Dare exemplifies the daring and rebellious nature of Hunters in the Destiny universe, who live by a code of honor that is defined by their actions and personal relationships rather than formal authority.
            Cayde's relationship with Andal Brask, in particular, adds depth to the Hunter Vanguard mantle. The tragic events surrounding Andal’s death, at the hands of Taniks the Scarred, set the stage for Cayde's eventual acceptance of the Vanguard role, even though he initially seemed reluctant to be tied down by such responsibility. The bond they shared and the wager they made reflects the close-knit yet competitive nature of Hunters.
            The Dare also serves as a means for Hunters to avoid the formal selection process that other Vanguard classes (Warlocks and Titans) might adhere to. Instead, they rely on the outcome of risky bets and confrontations, making it both a literal and symbolic passing of the torch.
            Cayde's ultimate fate in Destiny 2: Forsaken added a poignant layer to this dynamic, as his own Dare left his position open for another Hunter to take up. However, as of now, no new Hunter Vanguard has been officially appointed, leaving the future of that role uncertain.
            The ongoing question of who will take up the mantle and whether the Vanguard Dare will continue to shape the legacy of Hunter leaders adds an element of mystery to the narrative.
        </p>
        <h3>Hunter Vanguard</h3>
        <p>
            As the Hunter Vanguard, Cayde found as many excuses as he could to escape his duties; and he was notorious for showing up in the nick of time. Despite his habits and longing
            for the field, he became close friends with the two other Vanguard, Zavala and Ikora. In his last testaments, Cayde-6 remarked, "the Vanguard was the best bet I ever lost".
            Joining the Vanguard during the City Age, he was crucial to the Tower defense and scouting throughout the system. Cayde held a pivotal role in the Taken War by helping the Guardian
            sneak abord The Dreadnought and kill Oryx, The Taken King. During the Red War, Cayde fiercely defended the Last City from the Red Legion, even after the loss of his light. After escaping to Nessus then
            reuniting with the Guardian and the other Vanguard, they retook the Last City from the Cabal.
        </p>
        <h3>Last Stand</h3>
        <p>
            Cayde-6, alongside the Guardian, traveled to the Reef to help Petra Venj quell a breakout from the Prison of Elders. After helping restore security, Cayde pursued the escaping Scorn Barons
            but was ambushed by them. During the fight, Pirrha, the Rifleman, destroyed Cayde’s Ghost, leaving him vulnerable to a true death. In a last stand worthy of only the truest Gunslingers, Cayde fought defiantly but was overpowered
            and confronted by Uldren Sov, who fatally shot him with Cayde’s own weapon, the Ace of Spades. Before dying, Cayde taunted Uldren and asked the Guardian not to blame themselves for his death.
            His final words to the Guardian were to relay messages to Ikora and Zavala, marking the end of his life and spurring the Guardian to seek revenge.
        </p>
        <h3>Destiny Jesus?!?!</h3>
        <p>
            In the years after Cayde-6's death, a new threat emerged in the Sol system—the Witness, a being of pure hate and darkness responsible for humanity's Collapse.
             As it sought to complete The Final Shape, merging the Traveler with the Vale, Vanguard Scout Crow made a wish to enter the Traveller and stop the Witness. 
             Once known as Uldren Sov, the man who killed Cayde-6, Crow’s wish twisted his desires and resurrected Cayde as a being of Light. Though ghostless and unable
              to wield the Light, Cayde was determined to help the forces of Light defeat the Witness.
            <br>
            <br>
            Cayde forgave Crow for the sins of his past life, and even gave him the title of new Hunter Vanguard. After his death Cayde, along with his ghost 
            Sundance, became one with the Traveller and its light. Cayde was part of both confrontations with the Witness, fighting bravely though lightless.
            In the final battle, Ghost sacrifices himself chanels the Guardians light to defeat the Witness in a blinding flash. Cayde then gave up his own light,
            his very being, to breath life back into Ghost. "My choice. My light. Nobody makes my fate but me." <em>-Cayde-6</em>
